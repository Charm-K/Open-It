## Open-It : A simulation application for disaster response education.

### Introduction
Instead of receiving face-to-face disaster response education at elementary, middle, and high schools, this project aims not only to help students cultivate disaster response knowledge in a simple and safe way, but also to compensate for the problems of disaster safety education currently in effect.
We used a game format with a storyline so that players could enjoy the content in the application.


### How to use
The main steps for using the 'Open-It!' application are as follows.
1. Students run the app and press the start button to experience disaster situations.
2. Experiential education consists of five chapters, and each chapter consists of a casual game format that allows you to learn how to respond to disasters over time. Students must pass all chapters based on what they have been educated in advance.
3. If player enter the his/her name after completing the experiential education, a screen will appear to prove that player have completed the experiential education well, and player can capture this screen to prove to the teacher whether he/she have completed it or not.
